To install on UNIX-compatible OS (such as Linux, Mac OS X):
Installing as plugable module

	1. Copy libfacecrop.so(or libfacecrop.dylib) to /usr/lib and LuxandFaceCrop.h to /usr/include (or to /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include)
	2. Go to luxand_facecrop folder and type "phpize && ./configure && make && make install"
	3. Make sure you have extension=luxand_facecrop.so in your php.ini


Compiling luxand_facecrop into PHP

	1. Copy libfacecrop.so(or libfacecrop.dylib) to /usr/lib and LuxandFaceCrop.h to /usr/include (or to /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include)
	2. Copy files from luxand_facecrop to $PHP_SOURCE_DIR/ext/luxand_facecrop
	3. In php source root directory run commands: "rm configure && ./buildconf --force"
	4. Configure PHP with command "./configure --with-luxand_facecrop"
	5. Run make && make install



To install on Windows:
	1. Get visual studio 2008 (no matter what version - express, pro or others; all should work) and install it
	2. Get and install windows sdk 6.1
	3. Get a php 5.3 current snapshot or 5.3 stable release archive (do not extract yet!)
	4. Create the folder "c:\php-sdk"
	5. Unpack the binary-tools.zip archive (http://pecl2.php.net/downloads/php-windows-builds/php-libs/) into this directory, there should be one sub-directory called "bin" and one called "script"
	6. Open the "windows sdk 6.1 cmd shell" (it's available from the start menu group) and execute the following commands in it:
		setenv /x86 /xp /release
	7. 
		cd c:\php-sdk\
	8.
		bin\phpsdk_setvars.bat
	9.
		bin\phpsdk_buildtree.bat php53dev
	10. Now extract the snapshot from 3. to C:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86 with your favourite unpacker (winrar should handle it) so that the following directory gets created: C:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php-5.3XXXXXXX
	11. Copy facecrop.lib to C:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\deps\lib\
	12. Copy luxand_facecrop directory to C:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php-5.3XXXXXXX\ext\ 
	13. If you want to build php with apache support copy all from lib and include directories from apache directory to C:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\deps\lib\ and C:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\deps\include\
	14. Run in the windows-sdk-shell: 
		cd C:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php-5.3XXXXXXX
	15. 	
		buildconf
	16. 	
		configure --help
	17. Then run configure with options you wish including --with-luxand_facecrop, e.g.
		configure --enable-apache2-2handler --enable-isapi --enable-cli --with-luxand_facecrop
	18.
		nmake
	19. If you want the resulting php to be zipped, run after this also:
		nmake snap
	20. The compiled php supporting facecrop is now under C:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php-5.3XXXXXXX\Release_TS, copy it with facecrop.dll to the desired location (e.g. to C:\Windows\System32\)
